Recoding and improving on first attempt at Javascript Calculator from The Odin Project. Was not happy with the functionality.

This project has been the most challenging so far. I have had to do a lot of research and solidify my understanding of Javascript fundamental; while also utilising some CSS that I have never used before. Some of these include:

JS:
-switch statements
-arrow functions
-manipulating the DOM
-for loops
-array methods

CSS:
-Css grid
-hover effects

The most challenging aspect of this project so far has been implimenting the logic behind the calculator function buttons as it requires some intricate use of an array as calculator storage.
